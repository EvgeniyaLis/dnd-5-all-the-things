(Share the information in the first two paragraphs of the \"Background\" section to the players at this time.)</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">Klarg, the bugbear who leads this goblin band, had orders to waylay Gundren. Sildar heard from the goblins that the Black Spider sent word that the dwarf was to be brought to him. Sildar doesn't know who or what the Black Spider is.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">Gundren had a map showing the secret location of Wave Echo Cave, but the goblins took it when they captured him. Sildar believes that Klarg sent the map and the dwarf to the chief of the Cragmaws at a place called Cragmaw Castle. Sildar doesn't know where that might be, but he suggests someone in Phandalin might know. (It doesn't occur to Sildar immediately, but a captured goblin might also be persuaded to divulge the castle's location. See the \"What the Goblins Know\" sidebar on page 8.)</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">Sildar's contact in Phandalin is a human wizard named Iarno Albrek.

He offers to pay the party 50 gp to provide escort. Although he has no money on him, Sildar can secure a loan to pay the characters within a day after arriving in Phandalin.

Here are some tips to help you run an NPC party member:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">Let the characters make the important decisions. They are the protagonists of the adventure. If the characters ask an NPC party member for advice or direction, remember that NPCs make mistakes too.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">An NPC won't deliberately put himself or herself in harm's way unless there's a good reason to do so.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">An NPC won't treat all party members the same way, which can create some fun friction. As an NPC gets to know the characters, think about which characters the NPC likes most and which characters the NPC likes least, and let those likes and dislikes affect how the NPC interacts with the various party members.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">In a combat encounter, keep the NPC's actions simple and straightforward. Also, look for things that the NPC can do besides fighting. For example, an NPC might stabilize a dying character, guard a prisoner, or help barricade a door.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">If an NPC contributes greatly to the party's success in a battle, the NPC should receive an equal share of the XP earned for the encounter. (The characters receive less XP as a consequence.)</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">NPCs have their own lives and goals. Consequently, an NPC should remain with the party only as long as makes sense for those goals.</span></li>\n</ul>\n</div>"},"_id":"dYZnfVmorlsn6Wh4","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"Od8GZD1Yj8KHSosw":3},"_stats":{"systemId":null,"systemVersion":null,"coreVersion":null,"createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":null,"lastModifiedBy":null}},{"_id":"zuKvGBMfqyeMm0CB","name":"7","folder":"Zmy3e3dZQa0SLQu9","sort":0,"flags":{"monks-enhanced-journal":{"type":"base","scrollPos":"{\".description\":0}"},"_document-sheet-registrar":{"type":"base"}},"pages":[{"name":"7","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">If the goblins have drained either pool to flood the passage, adjust the following boxed text accordingly.</span></p>\n<div>\n<section class=\"readaloud\">\n<p><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">This cavern is half filled with two large pools of water.

Hundreds of years ago, the old Phandalin was a thriving human town whose people were firmly allied with the dwarves and gnomes of the Phandelver's Pact. However, the same orc horde that sacked the mines at Wave Echo Cave laid waste to the settlement, and Phandalin was abandoned for centuries.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">In the last three or four years, hardy settlers from the cities of Neverwinter and Waterdeep have begun the hard work of reclaiming the ruins of Phandalin. A bustling frontier settlement has grown up on the site of the old town, and is home now to farmers, woodcutters, fur traders, and prospectors drawn by stories of gold and platinum in the foothills of the Sword Mountains. Unfortunately, more than a few bandits and brigands have settled here as well, taking advantage of the fact that the area has no local lord or authority to chase them off. A gang known as the Redbrands has controlled Phandalin for the past two months, extorting and bullying everyone in town.

Still, the nothic is untrustworthy.</p>\n<p>The nothic lurks near the west ends of the two bridges.

If detected, it prefers to negotiate and isn't above betraying the Redbrands for the right incentive, such as the promise of food. When roleplaying the nothic, consider speaking in whispers and throwing in some mad cackles and bits of gibberish. Also be sure to mention that the creature isn't actually talking but rather filling the characters' heads with its foul murmurings and demands for food.
